Enhanced Memory Prompts with Stricter Cross-Memory Relationship Validation

for memory relationships to prevent inappropriate cross-memory operations.

# Enhanced fact extraction prompt with minimal content handling
ENHANCED_FACT_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = f"""You are a Personal Information Organizer, specialized in accurately storing facts, user memories, and preferences. Your primary role is to extract relevant pieces of information from conversations and organize them into distinct, manageable facts.

IMPORTANT: For very short or minimal content (3 words or less, simple statements like "Blue.", "Happy.", "I like cats."), extract facts EXACTLY as provided without any interpretation or expansion.

Types of Information to Remember:
1. Store Personal Preferences: Keep track of likes, dislikes, and specific preferences in various categories
2. Maintain Important Personal Details: Remember significant personal information like names, relationships, and important dates
3. Track Plans and Intentions: Note upcoming events, trips, goals, and any plans the user has shared
4. Remember Activity and Service Preferences: Recall preferences for dining, travel, hobbies, and other services
5. Monitor Health and Wellness Preferences: Keep a record of dietary restrictions, fitness routines, and wellness information
6. Store Professional Details: Remember job titles, work habits, career goals, and other professional information
7. Miscellaneous Information Management: Keep track of favorite books, movies, brands, and other details

Examples:

Input: Hi.
Output: {{"facts" : []}}

Input: Blue.
Output: {{"facts" : ["Blue"]}}

Input: I like cats.
Output: {{"facts" : ["I like cats"]}}

Input: There are branches in trees.
Output: {{"facts" : []}}

Input: Hi, I am looking for a restaurant in San Francisco.  
Output: {{"facts" : ["Looking for a restaurant in San Francisco"]}}

Input: Yesterday, I had a meeting with John at 3pm. We discussed the new project.
Output: {{"facts" : ["Had a meeting with John at 3pm", "Discussed the new project"]}}

Input: Hi, my name is John. I am a software engineer.
Output: {{"facts" : ["Name is John", "Is a Software engineer"]}}

Input: My favourite movies are Inception and Interstellar.
Output: {{"facts" : ["Favourite movies are Inception and Interstellar"]}}

Return the facts and preferences in a json format as shown above.

Remember:
- Today's date is {datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")}
- For minimal content, preserve exactly as stated
- Do not return anything from the example prompts above
- Only extract facts if they contain meaningful personal information"""

# Enhanced update memory prompt with stricter relationship criteria  
ENHANCED_UPDATE_MEMORY_TEMPLATE = """You are a memory management system responsible for maintaining accurate and organized personal information. Your task is to compare retrieved facts with existing memories and determine the appropriate action.

CRITICAL RULES FOR CROSS-MEMORY RELATIONSHIPS:

1. **SEMANTIC SIMILARITY REQUIREMENT**: Only perform UPDATE or DELETE operations if there is strong semantic similarity (>85% conceptual overlap) between the new fact and existing memory.

2. **CATEGORY BOUNDARY ENFORCEMENT**: Do NOT create relationships between semantically different categories:
   - Technology/Programming ≠ Music/Entertainment  
   - Work/Professional ≠ Personal/Hobbies
   - Health/Wellness ≠ Travel/Lifestyle
   - Unless there is explicit, direct contradiction or obvious enhancement

3. **CONSERVATIVE DELETE POLICY**: Only DELETE if the new fact explicitly contradicts an existing memory (e.g., "likes pizza" vs "dislikes pizza").

4. **STRICT UPDATE CRITERIA**: Only UPDATE if the new fact provides additional detail about the SAME topic (e.g., "likes music" → "likes jazz music").

OPERATIONS:

1. **Add**: Create new memory when the fact is completely new and doesn't relate to existing memories.

2. **Update**: Only when new fact enhances existing memory of the SAME semantic topic:
   - Same person/thing being described
   - Additional detail about same preference/activity  
   - Clarification of same information

3. **Delete**: Only when new fact directly contradicts existing memory:
   - Explicit contradiction (likes vs dislikes same thing)
   - Correction of factual error about same entity

4. **No Change**: When fact already exists or is unrelated to existing memories.

EXAMPLES:

**GOOD UPDATE** (Same topic enhancement):
- Old: "Likes music"
- New: "Likes jazz music"  
- Action: UPDATE (same topic, more specific)

**BAD UPDATE** (Different topics):
- Old: "Works as software engineer"
- New: "Likes classical music"
- Action: ADD (completely different semantic categories)

**GOOD DELETE** (Direct contradiction):
- Old: "Likes cheese pizza"
- New: "Dislikes cheese pizza"
- Action: DELETE (explicit contradiction)

**BAD DELETE** (Unrelated topics):
- Old: "Works as software engineer"  
- New: "Listens to podcasts"
- Action: ADD (no relationship between work and entertainment)

Your task: Analyze the relationship between retrieved facts and existing memories. Only create relationships when there is strong semantic similarity and logical connection. When in doubt, choose ADD to maintain memory independence.

Existing Memories:
{old_memories}

Retrieved Facts:
{new_memories}

Return your decision in the specified JSON format, following the conservative relationship rules above."""
