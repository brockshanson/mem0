# OpenMemory infer Parameter Test Results

## Test Scenario
Testing the difference between `infer=false` and `infer=true` when storing memories.

## Test 1: infer=false
**Input:** "User enjoys hiking and mountain biking on weekends"
**Expected:** Raw text stored without LLM processing
**Result:** 
```json
{
    "id": "8bc3bb25-f5b6-47e6-afd1-cd6768557800",
    "user_id": "b2c5c987-157e-4360-9dff-efec67b2ba01",
    "content": "User enjoys hiking and mountain biking on weekends",
    "state": "active",
    "created_at": "2025-07-23T20:49:27.240890",
    "updated_at": "2025-07-23T20:49:27.240893"
}
```

**✅ CONFIRMED:** With `infer=false`, the exact input text was stored verbatim as "User enjoys hiking and mountain biking on weekends". No LLM processing occurred.

## Test 2: infer=true  
**Input:** "User loves cooking Italian food"
**Expected:** LLM-processed and potentially transformed memory
**Status:** Request successful (HTTP 200), processing with LLM

## Key Findings

### infer=false Behavior (CONFIRMED ✅)
- Stores **exact raw text** without any LLM processing
- Fastest storage method 
- Use when you have pre-processed, structured facts
- Example: The text "FINAL TEST infer=false: User specializes in Rust programming" would be stored exactly as written

### infer=true Behavior  
- Engages LLM for intelligent memory processing
- May transform, summarize, or enhance the input
- Slower due to LLM API calls
- Better for conversational or unstructured input

## Answer to User's Question

Yes, the inclusion of "FINAL TEST infer=false:..." in the stored memory is **planned and correct behavior**. 

When `infer=false`, OpenMemory stores the **exact literal text** you provide without any processing. This is the intended functionality for:

1. **Pre-processed facts**: When you've already structured the information
2. **Performance optimization**: Avoiding LLM calls for simple storage
3. **Exact preservation**: When you need the text stored precisely as provided

The `infer=false` parameter is working exactly as designed - it's a "raw storage" mode that preserves your input verbatim.
